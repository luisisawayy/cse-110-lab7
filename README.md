Question 1: The correct answer is 1 because setting up a test on GitHub can determine whether a piece of code is good to go before being pushed, enabling the ability to detect bugs or regression immediately, and preventing faulty code from being pushed. If it passes the tests, it is good to be pushed to the repo.

Question 2: No, testing if a function returns the correct output can be tested locally by one user and does not need End-to-End testing.

Question 3: Navigation mode gives more of an overall performance metric with regards to the page, while Snapshot mode is more for analyzing a page's current physical attributes and finding accesibility issues.

Question 4: According to the Diagnostic, here are three things we could do to improve the performance:

1. Reduce the JS execution time - reducing the time spent parsing, compiling, and executing JS.
2. Properly size images - Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time.
3. Preconnect to required origins - adding preconnect or dns-prefetch resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins.
